## Usage

Blocking handler mode. 
```clojure
(-> {:port   8080
     :routes [{:path         "/hello-world"
               :methods      [:get]
               :handler-mode :blocking
               :consumes     ["text/plain"]
               :handlers     [(fn [_req]
                                {:status  200
                                 :headers {"content-type" "application/json"}
                                 :body    (.getBytes "{\"greet\":\"Hello world!\"}")})]}]}
    donkey/create-server
    server/start)
```

Non-blocking handler mode.
```clojure
(-> {:port   8080
     :routes [{:path            "/greet/:name"
               :methods         [:get]
               :metrics-enabled true
               :consumes        ["text/plain"]
               :handlers        [(fn [req respond _raise]
                                   (future
                                     (respond
                                       {:status  200
                                        :headers {"content-type" "text/plain"}
                                        :body    (.getBytes
                                                   (str "Hello " (-> :path-params req (get "name"))))})))]}]}
    donkey/create-server
    server/start)
```

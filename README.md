## Usage

Blocking handler mode. 
```clojure
(-> {:port   8080
       :routes [{:path     "/hello-world"
                 :methods  [:get]
                 :handler-mode :blocking
                 :consumes ["text/plain"]
                 :handler  (fn [req]
                             {:status  200
                              :headers {"content-type" "application/json"}
                              :body    (.getBytes "{\"greet\":\"Hello world!\"}")})}]}
      donkey/create-server
      server/start)
```

Non-blocking handler mode.
```clojure
(-> {:port   8080
       :routes [{:path            "/greet/:name"
                 :methods         [:get]
                 :metrics-enabled true
                 :consumes        ["text/plain"]
                 :handler         (fn [req respond _raise]
                                    (future
                                      (respond
                                        {:status  200
                                         :headers {"content-type" "text/plain"}
                                         :body    (.getBytes
                                                    (str "Hello " (-> :path-params req (get "name"))))})))}]}
      donkey/create-server
      server/start)
```
